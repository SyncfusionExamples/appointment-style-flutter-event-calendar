# How to style the appointment in the Flutter Calendar?

A quick-start example to help you to style the appointment in the Flutter Calendar.

You can style the appointment text in the Flutter Event Calendar by using the calendar's [appointmentTextStyle](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/SfCalendar/appointmentTextStyle.html) property.

This style doesn't apply for the appointment's in the agenda view of month view, for agenda view appointments styling can be achieved by using the [appointmentTextStyle](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/AgendaStyle/appointmentTextStyle.html) property from the AgendaStyle.
